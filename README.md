# Predicting next word using Probabilistic approaches.
- Have mainly implemented Markov Chain like model for 2 and 3 word ngrams ( 5 words did not fit in free tier rshiny)


## TODO
- Calculate probabilities for single word also -1 gram - ( maybe top 1k words only)
- Remove low frequency ngrams
- Implement statistical testing - (chi squared)
