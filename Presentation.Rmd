## Executive Summary

In this presentation, I will present the next word prediction algorithm and its shiny app implementation. I have tried three algorithms on a part of the data provided. I could not use all the data due to memory constraints.

- A simple markov-chain approach, which predicts the next word for just one input word.

- A n-gram model which can predict next word for words between 2 and 5 words.

- A keras model, which is under work.

Codes for the project are in the github repository below:

## Markov Chain
<div class="columns-2">![](markov.png){width = 50%, height=80%}

- Tried and tested first order and higher order markovchain.
- It took more 30 minutes to fit for Six thousand samples, so I could not experiment with bigger strings.
- 2 thousand samples from each of the files were taken.
- Predictions were satisfactory as shown on the picture to the left
- Link to the notebook can be found here. [Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cc_ZBvqcr3A7GI9_2zOX06aoE4c46aZO?usp=sharing)

### **The simplest and best working model for me**
- User can input from 2 words to 5 words at the moment
- 2 hundred thousand samples were taken randomly from the 3 files.
- Ngram fitting was faster compared to markov chain
- Link to the notebook can be found here. [Colab for Ngram](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cc_ZBvqcr3A7GI9_2zOX06aoE4c46aZO?usp=sharing)
- The shinyapp that takes 2 to 3 words as input . [Shiny App](https://vsnupoudel.shinyapps.io/capstoneUptoThreeWords)
- The shinyapp takes upto 5 words. Delay might be upto 30 seconds the first time you run it.[Shiny App](https://vsnupoudel.shinyapps.io/capstoneFinal)

## Next steps and Conclusion
<div class="columns-2">

### **Have tried using Keras**
- Pretrained Word Embeddings approach used to train the model.
- This approach also uses Recurrent Neural Network cell called LSTM at its core.[Colab Link for Keras](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O4LMjz5oi1TBaIIsgt-bGnaL-2bEI2ga?usp=sharing)
- Of all the models, Ngram model performed the best
- Shinyapp has ngram model that takes only upto 5 words due to memory constraints.


### **Other options to consider**
- Back-off model
- Transformer Network
